- E (Eval) -> Evaluates the javascript data structure.
- P (Print) -> Print the result.

## 🚀Core Modules in NodeJS

- NodeJS is a set of built-in modules which you can use without further installation.
- fs - File system module for files and folders.
  - writeFileSync()
  - appendFileSync()
  - renameFileSync()
  - readFileSync()
  - writeFile()
  - appendFile()
  - readFile()
  
- NOTE 
  - while reading file we automatically get buffer data
            if you have to read without buffer data first must give file encoding as an argument. readFile('file', 'utf-8')
  - In, Asynchronus function the first argument of the callback is always an error.
